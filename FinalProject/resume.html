            <h1>Learn More About Me:</h1>
            <p class="aboutp">Hi there! My name is Sarah Stonehocker and I am originally from Brighton, Colorado. I was born and raised on a ranch there until I was 15. I then moved to Broomfield, CO where I went to Holy Family High School. There, I started taking more engineering and STEM focused classes. I fell in love with the creativity that engineering allowed me to have. I continued to take these classes until I graduated, planning on attending CU for computer science originally. I then switched to CTD so I could have more creative freedom with the projects I created, then adding a buisness minor. I am excited to see where my classes take me and what I am able to create.</p>
